    "text-part-one": "Needless to say that the war is equally intense on animal and plant life. The last European steppes, Gesner's tulip fields, and unique animal populations are in the combat zone. Unfortunately, reserve and national park staff cannot perform their duties when shells explode and snipers operate. The Chornobyl Radiation and Ecological Reserve must have borne the brunt: at least ",

    "text-part-four": "The Hetman National Park in Trostyanets is free from occupiers, but the territory is densely mined. Experts predict the wildfires' threat to grow in May-June, yet the Russian troops have stolen the firefighting equipment. For the record, fire is the leading cause of death in wildlife.\n\nA huge amount of the winter crop cultures that were stored in the National Gene Bank of Plants in Kharkiv, one of the largest seed banks in the world, was destroyed by russian air raids. Luckily, the bank employees were able to save most of the species of the unique seeds collection. However, the crops that have been sown are still in a vulnerable situation: the fields are polluted with mines, and the lack of fuel materials is also a big problem. Pink lakes and Red Book orchids - russia is wiping the Kinburn Spit Reserve off the face of the Earth as you read this. The National Gene Bank of Plants in Kharkiv, one of the largest seed banks in the world, was destroyed by russian air raids. The seeds of unique ancient plants are gone, and we will never be able to restore them. Bison, the largest European animal; Przewalski's horse, the only European wild horse; and the white-tailed eagle, the largest eagle in Europe - they are all in danger."
